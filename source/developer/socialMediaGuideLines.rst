Social Media GuideLines
=======================

The Apache Wave project may establish one or more social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, YouTube, etc.) that it can use to spread news about the project and promote the project.
Apache Wave Social Media Guidelines

Access to Social Media Accounts
-------------------------------
Access to the social media accounts can be granted to any committer or PMC member who would like to participate. When possible, access will be through tools that do not require disseminating the login credentials.

Do's and Don'ts for Social Media
--------------------------------
Before posting anything, you'll want to familiarize yourself with Apache's Media and Analyst Relations page and brand management page.

Whether you're posting from a personal account about Apache Wave or posting from one of the official accounts, there are a few things you want to keep in mind.

* Anything said in public is fair game for press.

    * Never post anything via social media you wouldn't want to see reported on news sites.
* Make sure what you're saying/sharing is appropriate for all audiences, and reflects well on Apache Wave.

    * Be polite when talking about Wave and responding to questions.
    * Informal voice is OK, unprofessional is not.
    * Absolutely no use of NSFW language, images, or scenarios when using official Apache Wave accounts â€“ and avoid associating Apache Wave with anything that is likely to be considered offensive.
* Share relevant, positive information.

    * Feel free to share stories about Apache Wave, whether they come from the Apache Wave community, tech press, or folks outside of the press and community.
    * Avoid sharing negative stories about "competing" projects.
    * Keep posts/reposts relevant. Everybody loves LOLCats, but it's probably best not to share them from the official Apache Wave social media accounts.
    * Please share event information so long as it's Apache Wave-related. e.g. Promoting an event where there are talks about Apache Wave is spot-on. Promoting an event only because a vendor that has an interest in Apache Wave is participating would be outside the scope of Apache Wave social media accounts.
* Be sure information is public

    * Companies sometimes discuss plans/ideas informally at events. It's often a good idea to ask before sharing information on social media if it might be considered non-public. (For example, information presented during a talk should be fair game. Information shared over dinner may not be for public dissemination.)
* Apache Wave does not have "sponsors", events and activities have sponsors.

    * Avoid language like $foo_company is sponsoring the Apache Wave project.
    * Companies can sponsor events and activities. For example, $foo_company is hosting a Apache Wave meetup in Atlanta this weekend.
    * When using group video chat tools, identify yourself in captions and "lower third" tools in relationship to your Apache Wave participation, unless a person is an invited guest with other affiliations.
* Don't use Apache Apache Wave social media accounts to promote unrelated commercial activities.
* When in doubt, ask

    * If you're unclear on whether a post or item is OK, ask on the Apache-dev list, preferably with a draft of what you'd like to post. Consider no response or a majority of committers not dissenting after 24 hours consent to publish; however, dissenting opinions should be considered respectfully prior to posting. Apache PMC members have a right of veto for Apache Wave-branded postings. The other contributors on the list will always be happy to discuss and guide other contributors on what is and isn't appropriate for our social media activities.
