Gallery Submission
==================

Google Wave features a gallery of extensions that users can browse and install,
and we love to include useful, fun, and "wave-y" extensions in that gallery.
If you think your extension is ready to be shared with the world,
then you can submit it for consideration in the gallery.

The gallery submission process is, appropriately, done entirely in Google Wave.
The 3-step process is shown below:

1) To get started, install the Submitty extension.

2) After installing, you can select "New Extension Submission" from the
"New wave" menu.

3) Then, fill out information in the new wave and follow the instructions for
sharing it with us.

We look forward to reading more about your extension, and discussing it in
Google Wave. See you there!
