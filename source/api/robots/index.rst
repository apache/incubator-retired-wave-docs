Google Wave Robots API
======================

A robot is an automated participant on a wave. A robot can read the contents of
a wave in which it participates, modify the wave's contents, add or remove
participants, create new blips and new waves, and insert content into waves.
In short, a robot can perform many of the actions that any other participant
can perform. Robots are created and manipulated using the
Google Wave Robots API.

You can use the Robots API to perform actions such as the following:

* modify information in a wave
* insert elements such as gadgets and images in a wave
* interact with participants on a wave
* communicate and synchronize information in a wave to the outside world or to
  other waves
* access or modify state in a third-party system (such as a database)
